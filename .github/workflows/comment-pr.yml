Please check the results above and **fix all entries marked with ❌**.  
Entries with ⚠️ severity should also be fixed, though those can be acceptable on a case‑by‑case basis.

To submit your fixes, either commit them to this pull request or open a new one.

If there are no issues, your PR will be merged by an operator without further actions from your side.
